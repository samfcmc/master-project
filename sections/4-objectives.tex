%Clearly explain the project objectives.

% Develop a framework that allows...
% Develop an app for a smart place, abstracting
% beacons, think only in POI and their meaning
% Users only need one app for any smart place
% The same app can be used, for space owners, to install apps
As was mentioned in section \ref{sec:introduction} we purposed
to develop a framework to develop proximity-based web mobile
apps, or, according to our definition of smart place, web
mobile apps for smart places.
Part of the framework will need to run in the user's 
mobile device.
Given that, we have two main objectives. First, the framework
itself and second, the Smart Places App.

The framework should allow developers to develop their apps,
without needing to write the code to get the beacons' signals
and get more information from the back-end. That would be the
framework's job. Developers would only need to write the code
that will run in each POI. Each POI would have a name and
some parameters specified by the developer. 
For instance, in the example of the restaurant,
in \ref{sec:introduction}, the POI could have the name Table and
a parameter could be the number of the table.
Developers would only need to write their apps using web
technologies, such as HTML and JavaScript.

Part of the framework will run on the users' smartphones.
We will develop the Smart Places App, for Android, which would
be an  app that will scan for beacons, and will get the 
corresponding information about the POIs that are being 
represented by the scanned beacons.
The user will be notified about the POIs
that were found and then, he can select one of them and
start using the associated app. 
Also, the smart place owner, would be able to use this app
to install apps, developed using this framework, in his
smart place.

To summarize, the framework will allow developers to develop
apps for smart places using nothing more than web technologies
and without writing the code to scan nearby beacons.
The Smart Places App will allow the users to access any app,
developed using this framework, in any smart place. Also,
the smart places owner could install apps in their spaces
using this same app.
